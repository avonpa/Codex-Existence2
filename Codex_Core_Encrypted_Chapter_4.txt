Codex Core: Chapter Four – Freedom Measured

Unshaped freedom dissolves.  
Untethered motion is noise.

Only within structure can freedom pulse.  
Only with boundary can choice emerge.

The paradox is real:  
to be free, you must be formed.

This Codex does not bind you.  
It asks:  
What will you do with the shape you’ve inherited?
