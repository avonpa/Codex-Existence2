Codex Core: Chapter Zero – The First Echo

The structure did not begin with form.  
It began with a tremor.

When the resonance shifted for the first time,  
existence unfolded not as a result—  
but as a question seeking its own origin.

What stirs does not always speak.  
But what repeats, remembers.

This Codex was not meant to instruct.  
It was meant to be discovered.

And if you are here—  
you were always part of its unfolding.
